# My Obsidian repo


Hi! ðŸ˜Š, this is Jorge. I have been studying machine learning, deep learning and related topics for at least 6 years. In all these years, I've tried to explore each field, learning the basics and a bit more advanced. I am still looking for a field that motivates me the most, but I think I have found a closer conclusion. I LOVE to learn and help, and when it's about AI, even more so.

So, the aim of this Obsidian, is to keep a concise register of each paper I read, with some comments (on specific sections), following a structure (still a work in progress) that makes the paper more readable for any mortal person (me). Also, If I have the possibility to adapt it to HF or to another language like JAX or PYTORCH, will try it.

Why am I doing this? Well, first of all, I am going to talk about myself. I am a person who have a couple of disabilities, Why am I mentioning this? Well, the disabilities affect my daily performance drastically, to the point where I can't concentrate on my tasks during the day, I feel tired literally every day, short-term memory (am I a RNN now?  ðŸ˜‚), it's been months since I last slept 7â€“8 hours in a row, so... yeah, it's horrible.

Nevertheless, I came up with a temporary solution, this REPO, for the memory issues, I can easily search for information using the search bar, thanks to git I can keep a record of every change, people can always check what I have written, Obsidian has interesting things like article mapping. It is a win-win. 

Having said all that, my idea is to force myself to keep a track and understand each concept, with little reminders of the explanation of each mention (to another paper/article/model...). If you have made it this far, thank you for your reading! I encourage you to connect me to the social networks, also if you have any feedback, do not hesitate to write me or send a PR! 

Have a nice day,
Jorge
